# opencv-stuff
A repo for messing around with/learning [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)

OpenCV is made in C++, but there's a Java wrapper of it [here](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv).

Note: If you have the git bash interface installed, you can edit stuff by typing
vi <filename>. [Here's a good link for vi commands](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html).

Just as a test to make sure we all know how to edit this, type your GitHub 
user name in the list below:
- Bleu-Box
